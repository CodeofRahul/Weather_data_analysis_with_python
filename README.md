# Weather_data_analysis_with_python

In this repository i have analyse the Weather data. In order to run analysis on the dataset I have import the downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.com then imported the data in colab notebook. I have first perform the EDA on the dataset to understand the data. To analyse the weather data I have solved 10 questions.

- Those questions are :
  
1. Find all the unique 'wind speed' values in data
2. Find the no. of times when the Weather is exactly clear
3. Find the no. of times when the wind speed was exactly 4Km/h
4. Get the average value of 'Visibility'
5. What is the standarad deviation of 'Pressure' in dataframe
6. What is variance of 'Relative Humidity' in this data frame
7. Find all instances when 'Snow' was recorded.
8. Find all instances when 'Wind Speed' is above 24 and 'Visibility' is 25
9. Change the Weather column with Weather Status
10. Show all the records where Weather Status is Cloudy
